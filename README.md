# PlantWateringSystem
Plant watering circuit (with no software required)


Idea:
* Create a only hardware system (electrical circuit) that measures soil moisture and adds wate to the plant whenever needed.

Requirement:
* Should only water plants during the day (don't want that nasty waterpump running at night, ruining my sleep!)
* Should indicate water left in water container
* Should have some control for watering -> pause and wait for soil moisture to increase -> water more -> stop if sufficient soil moisture
* Should be designed into the plant pot, i.e., no external components. 
* USB power supply (Future battery driven??? -> Design for efficiency and low power consumption)
